🍽️ UFood – Restaurant Finder App
A Vue.js application developed as part of the GLO-3102 Web Application Development course at Université Laval.
This app allows users to explore restaurants, manage favorites, log visits, and connect with other users.
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HenryGarrafa/UFood-Vue-App.git
cd UFood-Vue-App
2. Install dependencies
npm install

The app will start on http://localhost:5173 by default.
